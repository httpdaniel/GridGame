# GridGame

For this assignment I was asked to create a grid which was then occupied with animals and seeds, the animals took turns moving into random parts of the grid, if they landed on a seed they would eat it and absorb it's energy. The winner was the animal with the most energy at the end. I was asked to use inheritance to create an animal chain with both birds and felines, canaries and cats being the leaf nodes. I was also asked to implement abstract classes and interfaces to follow the composite design pattern.
